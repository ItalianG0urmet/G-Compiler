# Gourmet Compiler ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Linux-only-blue) ![InDev](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-InDev-red)

**Description:**

This is a simple compiler for a custom-made language that I am creating. It will be a C-like language with some modern features.  
You may ask why this project? It's simple: I noticed how today's technology has spoiled us in the programming world, so my goal is to build this project using plain C, without any IDE. I'm using Vim without autocomplete or error checking â€” just me and my code.

**Build instructions:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItalianG0urmet/gourmet-compiler.git
cd gourmet-compiler/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./compiler
```
